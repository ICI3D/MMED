The International Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data (ICI3D) Program invites applications to the eleventh Clinic on Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED). This 2-week modeling clinic will bring together graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and other researchers from around the world, with the goal of engaging the participants in epidemiological modeling projects that use real data to grapple with practical questions in a meaningful way.

The Clinic will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and tutorials that will guide participants through the process of developing data‐based, dynamical models of disease spread and using models to answer public health questions. Participants are encouraged to bring data sets and questions to the Clinic, and to start collaborative projects with each other or the organizers. Various statistical and dynamical modeling paradigms will be explored. Computer exercises and group projects will reinforce and extend the concepts covered, and participants will gain experience using tools such as R, R Studio, git, and GitHub for collaborative projects. Please review [the previous schedule from MMED 2023](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule/2023) for additional information on the topics covered.

During the first week of the Clinic, all participants will be required to present on previous or ongoing research that is related to the Clinic's themes. Participants will be required to complete a written report on group projects and are encouraged to further develop these projects beyond the Clinic.

Students, researchers, and other professionals with a demonstrated interest in infectious disease surveillance, research, or control are encouraged to apply. The Clinic targets participants with a strong quantitative background and some prior knowledge of mathematical modeling in epidemiology but limited experience integrating data and models to address applied questions in infectious disease dynamics.

The course registration fee is ZAR 35,000. A small number of scholarships are available. All participants must have access to high-speed internet for the duration of the Clinic. The Clinic will require a full-time commitment (40 hours per week) on Monday – Friday for the two weeks of the Clinic. The time commitment will be split between fixed, interactive sessions and flexible individual work, to accommodate participants across multiple time zones.

The application process for the Clinic is highly competitive. Preference will be given to applicants that have the most to gain from Clinic participation.  Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.

- The deadline for receipt of applications for MMED {{page.year}} is April 11, {{page.year}} at 5pm Eastern (New York).
