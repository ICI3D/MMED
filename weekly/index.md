## Messages 2 & 3

**Please note: We attempted to send a message last week but realized today that it did not go through. We have therefore combined weekly messages 2 and 3 below. Apologies for any confusion or inconvenience.**

Thank you to everyone who has sent their GitHub information and photo. If you have not already sent your GitHub username and a recent photo to <github@ici3d.org>, please do so as soon as possible. **You will need to log in to your GitHub account to access some preparation materials.**

This week, we ask that you:

1. Please fill out [this form](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/logistics/logisticsForm) to let us know if you have any **dietary restrictions**, your **t-shirt size**, and a few field trip related questions no later than **17:00 SAST on Thursday 10 May**.

1. Check out the [MMED Poster Guidelines](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/posters), and begin working on your poster. If you would prefer not to travel with your poster, note that you can submit your poster to <posters@ici3d.org> by 17:00 (South African standard time) on May 18 to have your poster printed for you and delivered to AIMS. Additional information about submitting your poster for printing is available via the link above.

1. Please begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used at MMED. You can find a list of software to install (along with information about poster preparation and other preparatory materials) linked from the [Preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation).

    - We ask that you install R and Rstudio on a computer and begin to work with them this week. **You should work through the Rstudio tutorial and the three introductory R tutorials (i.e. Tutorials 0-3 on [the preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/preparation/) before the Clinic and complete [the associated quiz](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD) here.**

1. North American participants who have not yet booked flights need to do so as soon as possible, unless alternative arrangements have already been approved.

## Message 1

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2018 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, from May 28-June 8. Each week between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete a specific task in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED participants GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by 14:00 (Cape Town time, or 8am Eastern) by Tuesday, May 1.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

If you are already familiar with GitHub, you should also feel free to explore the repository on your own. Please note, however, that the repository is in development and materials are subject to change as the Clinic approaches.

We have also posted a [preliminary schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/mmed/schedule).

We are looking forward to seeing you in Muizenberg in May!

Steve Bellan, Rebecca Borchering, Faikah Bruce, Jonathan Dushoff, Eduard Grebe, John Hargrove, Carl Pearson, Juliet Pulliam, Eva Ujeneza and Brian Williams ([The MMED faculty](http://www.ici3d.org/people/))
