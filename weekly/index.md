## Message 4

This week, we ask that you begin to familiarize yourself with git, the version control system we'll be using for collaborative projects, by completing [this free, browser-based tutorial from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). If you are already comfortable using git, you can skip this activity, but if you're new to git or your skills are rusty, please take the time to work through all four lessons (Basic Git Workflow, How to Backtrack in Git, Git Branching, and Git Teamwork). Investing 2-3 hours of time learning git _now_ will pay off down the line! More information is available on the [Preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation).

In addition, we would like to make sure you are aware that you will be working on group projects during the second week of the Clinic and that you will be responsible for submitting a written report on your project by August 1. Guidelines for preparing and submitting the report are available [here](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/projectReports). We will begin providing outlines of potential projects next week. In the meantime, if you have a data set that you would be able to share and that you think could form the basis of a good project, please let us know.

**Please remember to complete [the quiz associated with R tutorials 0-3](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD) here.**

This week, please begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used at MMED. You can find a list of software to install (along with information about poster preparation and other preparatory materials) linked from the [Preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation).

We ask that you install R and Rstudio on a computer and begin to work with them this week. **You should work through the Rstudio tutorial and the three introductory R tutorials (i.e. Tutorials 0-3 on [the preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/) before the Clinic and complete [the associated quiz](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD).**

In addition, if you will be bringing a laptop to the Clinic, please be sure to install all the required software on your machine before your arrival.

This week, please check out the [MMED Poster Guidelines](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/posters). If you would prefer not to travel with your poster, note that you can submit your poster to <posters@ici3d.org> by 5pm (Cape Town time) on May 19 to have your poster printed for you and delivered to AIMS.

Thank you to everyone who has sent their GitHub information and photo. If you have not already sent your GitHub username and a recent photo to <github@ici3d.org>, please do so as soon as possible. **You will need to log in to your GitHub account to access some preparation materials.**

If you are a facebook user, you are also encouraged to join [our facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/206225166162804/).

If you have any thoughts, comments, or questions about MMED content, please email us at <faculty@ici3d.org>. For logistical information, please continue to contact Sara Ervin, the ICI3D Program assistant, at <admin@ici3d.org>. North American participants who have not yet booked flights need to do so as soon as possible, unless alternative arrangements have already been approved.

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2017 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, from May 29-June 9. Each week between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete a specific task in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED 2017 GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by 14:00 (Cape Town time, or 8am Eastern) by Monday, May 1.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

If you are already familiar with GitHub, you should also feel free to explore the repository on your own. Please note, however, that the repository is in development and materials are subject to change as the Clinic approaches.

We have also posted a [preliminary schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/mmed/schedule).

We are looking forward to seeing you in Muizenberg in May!

Steve Bellan, Rebecca Borchering, Jonathan Dushoff, John Hargrove, Calistus Ngonghala, Travis Porco, Juliet Pulliam, Cari van Schalkwyk, Jim Scott and Brian Williams ([The MMED faculty](http://www.ici3d.org/people/))
