## Notes
* Do we need this header? Wait for JP to make the public version
* Eliminate unnecessary date and year refs (keep the dates of the clinic in Message 1, request people do things by "next Tuesday" when possible)

## Message 6

We hope you're enjoying the Clinic so far!

Just a few final notes to help you get the most out of the next two weeks:

- All of the project descriptions are now posted on the [Projects](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/projects/) page, including a few that were added over the weekend. We recommend taking a look at all the potential projects before Thursday afternoon.
- All participants have been assigned to one of two tracks:
    - **Track A** is for those of you with a more mathematical background.
    - **Track B** is for those of you with a background in epidemiology or public health.
    - There are _two exceptions_ to this: If you've previously attended the DAIDD clinic, you've been placed in Track A. If you've previously attended the MMED clinic (eg, as a MedPh student), you've been placed in Track B.
    - Track assignments are available from [this link](www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/participants/trackAssignments), and also indicated by color (A = red, B = blue) on the participant facebook.
    - We have considered the track assignments carefully and ask that you not change tracks; however, if you feel strongly that you would get more out of being in the other track, please discuss this with **Gavin Hitchcock**, who will reassign you if he agrees.
- There are several opportunities throughout the Clinic for participants to sign up for short one-on-one meetings with the MMED faculty. These are referred to as **Mentoring Sessions** on the schedule, and the first one is on Tuesday afternoon. These meetings are an opportunity for you to get to know the faculty better and for you to make sure you get _what you need_ from the Clinic. You can use the time however you like - e.g., to seek career advice, get guidance on a research project, or find out more about the faculty member's background. We suggest you pay close attention through the first week to figure out which faculty member/s you would most like to meet with and sign up for at least one meeting! In the meantime, you can learn more about each of the faculty members from the links provided on the [ICI3D Faculty & Staff page](http://www.ici3d.org/people/).
- On the **morning of Wednesday 8 June**, Brian Williams will lead a discussion of two papers that make different predictions for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Mozambique. These papers are available via links from the schedule page and also in the **Readings** folder of the MMED 2018 repository. Please be sure to read them before the morning of the 8th.

Thanks for reading, and have a great Clinic!

## Message 5 (combined 5-6 from previous year)

1. Please review the [logistical information](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/logistics/) provided. **Note that some updates have been made in the last week, including additional details about arrivals and registration.** For example, the page includes a link to the current weather and forecast for Muizenberg. As you prepare to travel to AIMS, please keep in mind that it is winter in South Africa and consider packing a sweater and/or heavy jacket, especially if you are coming from a tropical location. Be sure to check out the information page for more helpful tips! Please pay particular attention to the arrival schedule (which will be available within 3 hours of this email) if you are flying into CPT, and let us know immediately via email to <arrival@ici3d.org> if there is any problem or discrepancy. We will update this schedule with shuttle times in the next couple of days. We recommend printing a copy of this page and bringing it with you to ensure you know where to go upon arrival and how to contact us in case of a delay. If you have trouble finding someone at the airport please call Igsaan (+27 72 216 5628, AIMS Head of Facilities & Logistics) or Steve (+27 71 923 8832).

1. Please fill out [this form](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/logistics/logisticsForm) to let us know if you have any **dietary restrictions**, your **t-shirt size**, and a few field trip related questions no later than ***10pm Cape Town time on Thursday May 25***.

1. Please make sure your poster is ready to go ([see guidelines](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/posters)). All posters we have received have been sent for printing. If we have not received your poster, the deadline for printing has passed and we expect you to print it and bring it with you. Everyone should also bring an electronic copy of their poster.

1. Please ensure you have completed the required R and git tutorials and the associated online [quiz](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD) if you haven't already.

1. Please note that we have posted the first set of possible projects on the [projects page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/projects/). We will be posting more over the next few days. We recommend that you browse through the project descriptions before the Clinic to familiarize yourself with the options.

1. If you will be bringing a laptop computer to the Clinic, now would be a good time to double-check that you have all of the [necessary software](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/preparation#Software) installed on the computer you will be using. Desktop computers (with appropriate software) will be available for use by those who need them.

1. Finally, everyone should note that breakfast at AIMS is served from 7:45 to 8:30. If you arrive in Muizenberg after 18:00 on Sunday, you will need to register on Monday morning, so be sure to give yourself sufficient time to register and eat!

1. Please do not hesitate to let us know at <faculty@ici3d.org> if you have any questions! 

## Message 4

This week, we ask that you begin to familiarize yourself with git, the version control system we'll be using for collaborative projects, by completing [this free, browser-based tutorial from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). If you are already comfortable using git, you can skip this activity, but if you're new to git or your skills are rusty, please take the time to work through all four lessons (Basic Git Workflow, How to Backtrack in Git, Git Branching, and Git Teamwork). Investing 2-3 hours of time learning git _now_ will pay off down the line! More information is available on the [Preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/preparation).

In addition, we would like to make sure you are aware that you will be working on group projects during the second week of the Clinic and that you will be responsible for submitting a written report on your project by August 1. Guidelines for preparing and submitting the report are available [here](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/projects/projectReports). We will begin providing outlines of potential projects next week. In the meantime, if you have a data set that you would be able to share and that you think could form the basis of a good project, please let us know.

**Please remember to complete [the quiz associated with R tutorials 0-3](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD) here.**

## Message 3

This week, please begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used at MMED. You can find a list of software to install (along with information about poster preparation and other preparatory materials) linked from the [Preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/preparation).

We ask that you install R and Rstudio on a computer and begin to work with them this week. **You should work through the Rstudio tutorial and the three introductory R tutorials (i.e. Tutorials 0-3 on [the preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED2018/preparation/) before the Clinic and complete [the associated quiz](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD) here.**

In addition, if you will be bringing a laptop to the Clinic, please be sure to install all the required software on your machine before your arrival.

## Message 1

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2018 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, from May 28-June 8. Each week between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete a specific task in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED participants GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by 14:00 (Cape Town time, or 8am Eastern) by Tuesday, May 1.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

If you are already familiar with GitHub, you should also feel free to explore the repository on your own. Please note, however, that the repository is in development and materials are subject to change as the Clinic approaches.

We have also posted a [preliminary schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/mmed/schedule).

We are looking forward to seeing you in Muizenberg in May!

Steve Bellan, Rebecca Borchering, Faikah Bruce, Jonathan Dushoff, Eduard Grebe, John Hargrove, Carl Pearson, Juliet Pulliam, Eva Ujeneza and Brian Williams ([The MMED faculty](http://www.ici3d.org/people/))
