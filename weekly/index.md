## Message 3

This week, we ask that you begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used at MMED. You can find a list of software to install (along with information about poster preparation and other preparatory materials) linked from the [Preparation](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/) page.

Please install R and Rstudio on a computer and begin to work with them. **You should work through the Rstudio tutorial and the three introductory R tutorials (i.e. Tutorials 0-3 on [the preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/) before the Clinic and complete [the associated quiz](https://survey.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cAV8F8D4hUfiXdj) here.** (If you are already an intermediate or advanced R user, you may skip to the Benchmark Questions for Tutorials 1-3, and complete the quiz. If you find that you are unfamiliar with any of the material covered in the questions, we recommend that you work through the associated tutorial.)

You should also begin to familiarize yourself with git, the version control system we'll be using for collaborative projects. To do this, please complete [this free, browser-based tutorial from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). If you are already comfortable using git, you can skip this activity, but if you're new to git (or your skills are rusty), please take the time to work through all four lessons (Basic Git Workflow, How to Backtrack in Git, Git Branching, and Git Teamwork). Investing 2-3 hours of time learning git _now_ will pay off down the line! More information is available on [the preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation).

**Feedback from participants in previous years has often included comments on how they wish they had invested more time in learning R and git _before_ the beginning of the Clinic, so we encourage you to start these tutorials now and work through them steadily over the next week and a half.**

If you are a Facebook user, you are also encouraged to join the [MMED 2019 Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/406006909952568/), which you can use to post questions you have about the tutorials, as well as to start getting to know some of the participants and instructors.

## Message 2

Thank you to everyone who has sent their GitHub information and photo. If you have not already sent your GitHub username and a recent photo to <github@ici3d.org>, please do so as soon as possible. **You will need to log in to your GitHub account to access some preparation materials.**

This week, we ask that you:

1. Fill out [this form](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/logistics/logisticsForm) to let us know if you have any **dietary restrictions**, your **t-shirt size**, and a few field trip related questions no later than **17:00 SAST on Tuesday 7 May**.

1. Check out the [MMED Poster Guidelines](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/posters), and begin working on your poster. If you would prefer not to travel with your poster, note that you can submit your poster to <posters@ici3d.org> by 17:00 (South African standard time) on May 17 to have your poster printed for you and delivered to AIMS. Additional information about submitting your poster for printing is available via the link above.

1. Send your arrival and departure information to Amanda October at <admin@ici3d.org> no later than **17:00 SAST on Friday 10 May**! This is essential for us to arrange airport transfers and accommodation. Even if you live locally, you should confirm your arrival and departure dates. By default, we expect you will arrive on 26 May and depart on 8 June. If you would prefer not to drive to Muizenberg, Amanda will also be able to assit with local transportation arrangements for participants and mentors.

## Message 1

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2019 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, from May 27-June 7. Each week between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete specific tasks in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED participants GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by 14:00 (Cape Town time, or 8am Eastern) by Tuesday 30 April.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

We have also posted a [preliminary schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule). Additional information about the program is included in the attached document, and further details will be added to the [MMED 2019 website](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED) between now and the Clinic.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Muizenberg in May!
