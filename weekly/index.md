## Message 1

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2018 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, from May 28-June 8. Each week between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete a specific task in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED participants GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by 14:00 (Cape Town time, or 8am Eastern) by Monday, May 1.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

If you are already familiar with GitHub, you should also feel free to explore the repository on your own. Please note, however, that the repository is in development and materials are subject to change as the Clinic approaches.

We have also posted a [preliminary schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/mmed/schedule).

We are looking forward to seeing you in Muizenberg in May!

Steve Bellan, Rebecca Borchering, Faikah Bruce, Jonathan Dushoff, Eduard Grebe, John Hargrove, Carl Pearson, Juliet Pulliam, Eva Ujeneza and Brian Williams ([The MMED faculty](http://www.ici3d.org/people/))
