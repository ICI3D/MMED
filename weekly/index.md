## Message 1

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2019 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, from May 27-June 7. Each week between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete specific tasks in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED participants GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by 14:00 (Cape Town time, or 8am Eastern) by Tuesday 30 April.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

We have also posted a [preliminary schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule). Additional information about the program is included in the attached document, and further details will be added to the [MMED 2019 website](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED) between now and the Clinic.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Muizenberg in May!
