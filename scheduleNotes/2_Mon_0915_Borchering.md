- Revisit the roadmap to remind people what was covered last week, and what the overall flow of the Clinic is like (webpage: http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/roadmap/, slides on the dropbox: ICI3D_Materials/MMED2018/MMED2018roadmap.pptx)
- Response to feedback:
    - Re-emphasize that evening sessions are optional. Talk titles are on schedule, and abstracts are linked.
    - Schedule of second week is very different and flexible. You're in charge of your time, and we end at 17:30. Will come back to this in a minute.
    - Mentoring sessions have been assigned and are posted on the door to the main lecture hall, and linked from the schedule.
- Pull up the schedule and talk through the structure of the second week (roughly: required plenary session in the morning, computer and/or work session after coffee break, lecture after lunch (some are optional), work and mentoring sessions in the afternoon, talks or work/computer sessions after dinner)
- Remind people that they will be in charge of much of their own schedule and should work with their groups to try to use the time as effectively and possible, and they should think about what they want out of the clinic and what they need to do in the second week to make sure they get it
- Let people know they can find their group project assignments at http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/, and that:
    - everyone (who filled out the form) was assigned to their first or second choice group
    - the schedule on Monday focuses heavily on getting the projects up and running, and much of the week should be spent on the projects
    - each group will give a lab-meeting-style presentation / progress report on Friday afternoon, prior to the final feedback session, and instructions are available here: http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/projectPresentations
    - each group will be responsible for submitting a written report on their work by August 1, and instructions are available here: http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/projectReports
- Announce Jonathan's public lecture on Tuesday
- Let people know that the final research presentation will be on Wednesday evening, and will be a special guest lecture by Cari van Schalkwyk from SACEMA, who will be discussing her work on HPV / HIV interactions
- Remind people that Gavin will be gone on Monday and Tuesday and that they should share their feedback with Masimba in his absence
