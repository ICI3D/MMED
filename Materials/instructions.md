# Model Diagram

See the [step-by-step guide](./modelWorld) for creating a model world (Step 6). The final version of your diagram should include both your research question and a key / legend that defines all symbols.

# Model Description

Your model description should fully describe your model world, including all processes, how they connect compartments, and the parameters that define rates of flow. An example model description for the rabies example can be found [here](./modelDescription).
