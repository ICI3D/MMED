#### Before you start

1. Clone the repository to an appropriate location on your local machine (eg: `git clone https://github.com/ICI3D/Sandbox.git`)
1. Change into the directory of the cloned repository (eg: `cd Sandbox`)
1. Create a development branch on your local machine, derived from master (`git checkout -b yourBranchName`)
1. Create a remote version of your development branch (`git push --set-upstream origin yourBranchName`)

#### Each time you're ready to start working

1. Change to your development branch (`git checkout yourBranchName`)
1. Pull changes from origin/master (`git merge origin/master`)
1. Resolve any conflicts
1. Add and commit the changes (eg: `git commit -am'your commit message')
1. Work on your files

#### Each time you're ready to add content to the master branch

1. Add and commit the changes that are ready for inclusion in origin/master (eg: `git commit -am'your commit message')
1. Change to the master branch (`git checkout master`)
1. Pull changes from origin/master (`git pull`)
1. Merge development branch into local copy of master (`git merge yourBranchName`)
1. Resolve any conflicts
1. Add and commit the changes (eg: `git commit -am'your commit message')
1. Pull changes from origin/master (`git pull`)
    - Return to Step 5 if any new merge conflicts have been generated by changes made by others in the meantime
1. Push the changes to origin/master (`git push`)
1. Switch back to your development branch (`git checkout yourBranchName`)
1. Merge master back into your development branch (`git merge master`)
