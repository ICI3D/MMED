Panum's Measles Investigations
------------------------------

- Please download [this pdf]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/readings/Panum_Measles_1846.pdf?raw=true) and read the following pages: 3-5, 49, 57-73. The rest are optional. These pages numbers refer to the page numbers just below the text.
- While reading you can use the following [vocabulary guide]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/readings/Panum_Vocab.doc?raw=true) for some of the more unusual words.
- While reading, think about what characteristics of Panum's thinking made his investigation useful:
    - What were the first things he wrote about?
    - What kind of data did he collect? Why
    - List the conclusions he came to
    - Why did he exclude the data on Sudero?
    - What is the evidence against miasmatic transmission?
    - What is the one "counter-example" he found and how was it useful?
