Dear Mike,

On behalf of the [ICI3D](https://www.ici3d.org/) core faculty, it is my pleasure to invite you to join us for MMED 2021 as a Faculty Observer. MMED 2021 will be an online event. As faculty observer, you would be able to participate as much as you like in the faculty activities but would also be free to experience the Clinic more from the participants' perspective, to whatever extent you prefer (e.g. working through tutorials with participants, rather than being expected to answer their questions about the material). The Faculty Observer role is a way for you to familiarize yourself with our approach and for the faculty to get to know you better (and therefore how you fit in with what we do) - the hope being that you might come back in future years as a member of the Workshop Faculty. 

The dates for MMED 2021 are June 28-July 9. For a program overview, you can refer to [our 2019 schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule/2019).  

As a Faculty Observer, we would expect you to:

* prepare a faculty profile, to be posted on the ici3d website
* hold some one-on-one mentoring sessions with participants during the Clinic itself
* engage fully with the workshop program, including attending plenary sessions and selected parallel sessions, and attending for the full 2 weeks (you would be expected to reduce other commitments to a minimum, as you would if you were attending an in-person intensive workshop)
* give a faculty research lecture [~40 minutes + questions]

You would also be welcome, but not obligated, to:

* attend daily faculty meetings during the workshop
* develop an idea for a group project that students could pursue in the second week of the Clinic, including a summary of what the project would entail, to be posted on the website several weeks in advance [you can see the [format and some examples from last time](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/2019) (click on the topic links, not the repository links)]
   * this can be done in discussion with other faculty, if you like
   * ideally projects include both a data and a modeling component and should be well defined enough that students can make substantial headway
	* lead (or co-lead) a project group in the second week of the Clinic, and lead the review of the project report after it is submitted [deadline Aug 1; more info on this process to be provided in the meantime]
* lead an optional instructional session in the second week on a special topic of your choosing
Please let us know by 7 Jun whether or not you will be able to attend. Also, please feel free to contact Juliet (our Africa Director) or me with any questions.

Best regards,


Jonathan (N. America Director, ICI3D) on behalf of the ICI3D Core Faculty
