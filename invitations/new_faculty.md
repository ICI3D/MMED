Dear Tendai,

On behalf of the [ICI3D](https://www.ici3d.org/) core faculty, it is my pleasure to invite you to join us for MMED 2021 as a Faculty Member. MMED 2021 will be an online event. 

The dates for MMED 2021 are June 28-July 9. For a program overview, you can refer to [our 2019 schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule/2019).  

As a Faculty Member, we would expect you to:

* help with the participant-selection process
* prepare a faculty profile, to be posted on the ici3d website
* participate in planning calls leading up to the Clinic
* work with us to find first-week lectures that you can take over
* take intellectual ownership of all assigned sessions and work with core faculty to update and improve them
* work with the core faculty to develop project groups [you can see the [format and some examples from last time](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/2019) (click on the topic links, not the repository links)]
* lead a project group (possibly with a mentor or another faculty member), and coordinate the review of the project report (in August)
* hold mentoring sessions
* help oversee and provide support/feedback to the mentors on an as-needed basis
* help identify participants who would make good I3D scholars and/or future mentors
* attend daily faculty meetings during the workshop
* engage fully with the workshop program, including attending plenary sessions and selected parallel sessions, which will require committing the bulk of your work time for the duration of the Clinic

Please let us know by 7 Jun whether you can participate. Also, please feel free to contact Juliet (our Africa Director) or me with any questions.

Best regards,

Jonathan (N. America Director, ICI3D) on behalf of the ICI3D Core Faculty
