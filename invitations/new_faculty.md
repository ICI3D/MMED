MMED Faculty expectations
• help with the participant-selection process
• participate in full-group planning calls leading up to the Clinic (~ every 2 weeks, starting sometime in April)
• work with us to find first-week lectures that you can take over
• take intellectual ownership of all assigned sessions and work with core faculty to update and improve them
• work with the core faculty to develop projects groups
• lead a project group (possibly with a mentor or another faculty member), and coordinate the review of the project report (in August)
• hold mentoring sessions
• help oversee and provide support/feedback to the mentors on an as-needed basis
• help identify participants who would make good I3D scholars and/or future mentors
• engage fully with the workshop program, including attending plenary sessions and selected parallel sessions, which will require staying in Muizenberg for the duration of the Clinic
