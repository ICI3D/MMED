It is my pleasure to inform you that you've been selected for the opportunity to serve as a mentor at this year's MMED Clinic, which will be held 28 June â€“ 9 July 2021 virtually.

We are offering this opportunity to a small number of past MMED participants who we feel have strong research potential and an ability to communicate effectively, engage others, and provide constructive feedback on others' research. You should view this position as an honor, but - more importantly - as a growth opportunity. If you accept this position, you will have defined responsibilities both before and during the Clinic. Prior to the Clinic we would ask you to go through tutorials to fix bugs and familiarize yourself with the content, go through the papers to be read at the Clinic (the list is available on the website), and familiarize yourself with Git and our chosen Git GUI for the workshop. We expect this to take, on average, about 1-2 hour per week of your time, each week leading up to the Clinic. During the Clinic, you would assist participants during tutorials, lead discussions, help mentor group projects, and help with logistics to make sure the Clinic runs smoothly. In addition, you would give a short research presentation in the first week of the Clinic, and, if you desire, you would have the opportunity to develop a computer exercise on a topic of particular interest to you.

At this time, we are asking that you let us know whether you would like to participate in MMED 2021 in this capacity. If so, we will be in touch soon with further details. Please let us know by 31 May 2021. Also, please feel free to contact me or any of the other MMED faculty with any questions.

Best regards,

Zinhle (and Jonathan) \
On behalf of the MMED/ICI3D faculty
