## Overview

  <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p><b>What factors control and regulate tsetse fly population growth?</b></p>
      <p> Tsetse flies are the vectors of trypanosmiases, diseases of livestock and humans. The flies are unusual in only producing a single offspring at each 9-daily birth event.</p>
      <p> Moreover, developmental rates change in a highly predictable way with temperature. As such the growth of tsetse populations is particularly amenable to modelling.</p>
      <p> This group will develop an agent-based model for tsetse population growth and fit it to mark-recapture data collected in a study carried out on an island in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe .</p>
      <p> The data set in question has weekly estimates of population numbers, and birth and death rates, spanning a four-year period.  .</p>
      <p> We wish to identify the climatic factors impact tsetse birth and death rates - and whether we can detect the presence and point of action of density dependent effects.</p>

## Things to consider

- _This group is recommended for participants who are interested in :_
    - Tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis
    - Modelling the dynamics of population growth in an insect vector
    - Engaging, interpreting and analysing existing data
    - Agent-based models

- _This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:_
    - Writing code in R  
    - Developing an agent-based model
    - Fitting the agent-based model to existing mark-recapture estimates of population size, and mortality and birth rates
    - Examining and explaining how the above rates vary with season and climatic conditions
    - Determining, more generally, the density dependent and independent factors affecting population growth and regulation

## Background

- The mark-recapture study under consideration was carried out in Zimbabwe over an 4-year period in the early 1980s.
- Tsetse flies were captured on daily ox fly-rounds, marked with artists' oil paint, to denote the latest week of capture, and released.
- This procedure continued for more than 200 weeks, making it one of the most intensive mark-recapture exercises carried out on any insect.

## Data

The following data sources and other resources will be made available to group members:

- Mark-recapture estimates of population numbers, and birth and death rates for male and female tsetse flies of two species.
- Extensive meteorological data from Kariba Airport - some 10 km from Antelope Island, where the study was conducted
