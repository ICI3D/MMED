## Overview

South Africa is considering introduction of routine vaccination against rubella virus; however, there are concerns that vaccination will increase the average age of infection, which could in turn increase the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), as described in Metcalf _et al_. 2012:<br>

This group will explore the relationship between age and the force of infection, as a first step toward understanding the baseline risk of CRS in South Africa. The analysis will use cross-sectional serological data from the Western Cape, South Africa.

## Things to consider

- _This group is recommended for:_
    - Participants interested in understanding how models can be used to inform policy decisions
    - Participants interested in practicing formulation of likelihoods
    - Participants interested in developing code for fitting models

- _This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:_
    - Maximum likelihood fitting of catalytic models
    - Comparison of models using formal criteria
    - Use of reproducible research practices

## Data

- Data on IgG serostatus and age will be provided to project group members. Because the data are not publicly available, group members will be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement stating that they agree not to use the data for any purpose other than the MMED 2019 group project without explicit written permission.
