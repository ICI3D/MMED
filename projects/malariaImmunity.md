## Overview

An important question in understanding malaria dynamics is how infection plays out at the individual level, and particularly how it interacts with clinical immunity. Understanding the relative importance of clinically immune individuals in transmission has profound impacts for malaria interventions. *This group will analyze individual-level data and evaluate patterns of parasite load through time.*

## Things to consider

- **This group is recommended for:**
    -   Participants who are interested in malaria
    -   Participants who are interested in within-host dynamics, and implications for population-level patterns
    -   Participants who are interested in engaging, interpreting and analyzing published data
    -   Participants who are interested in statistical analyses
    -   Participants who would be a good fit for this group.
- **This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:**
    -   Obtain and clean data from published papers and reproducible research repositories
    -   Make statistical models of parasite load in individuals through time
    -   If desired: make dynamical models of parasite load in individuals
    -   If desired: use individual-level results to parameterize population-level models

## Background

Clinical immunity to malaria is an important medical, dynamical and public health phenomenon. The importance of *transmission from* clinically immune individuals â people who carry malaria parasites but are not clinically ill â in population-level dynamics is poorly understood.

## Data

### Garki project
-   The [Garki project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garki_Project) was an ambitious malaria-control and data-collection project carried out in Nigeria in the early 1970s
  - The [Garki project book][GarkiBook] is the best available explanation for [the available data][GarkiSwiss]

### Gonoa study
-   The [Gonoa study][BruceParasitemia] is [a detailed study of parasitemia through time in children][GonoaData]

-   [Ãguas _et al_. 2008][Aguas2008] suggested that transmission from clinically immune individuals could lead to "backwards bifurcations"; this issue is also addressed by [the Chiyaka 2013 review paper][Chiyaka2013].
