## Overview

The explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 seen in congregate settings such as prisons and nursing homes, has highlighted a critical need for effective outbreak prevention and mitigation strategies for these settings. A variety of control interventions can be represented by a three stage model. Specifically, introduction of disease into the resident population from the community can be modeled as a stochastic point process coupled to a branching process, while spread between residents can be modeled via a deterministic compartmental model that accounts for depletion of susceptible individuals. Control can be modeled as a proportional decrease in the number of susceptible residents, the reproduction number, and/or the proportion of symptomatic infections. Preliminary estimates suggest that for a reproduction number of 3.0 with density-dependent transmission, reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% can reduce overall disease burden by 47%

**The goal of this project is to refine estimates about the potential impact of control interventions in the California Prison System by fitting the model to surveillance data.**


## Things to consider


- _This group is recommended for:_
    - Those who want to learn about branching process models and/or parameter estimation
    - Those who are interested in linking surveillance data to predictions of the effect size of public health interventions.


- _This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:_
    - Applying modeling assumptions to raw data in order to adjust for observation bias
    - Inference of parameter values and evaluation of model performance
    - Review of relevant literature
