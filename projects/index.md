## Acknowledgments for publications resulting from ICI3D Projects or otherwise influenced by an ICI3D workshop

If you publish a paper that comes either directly out of an MMED
project group or indirectly is helped by attendance of MMED, please
acknowledge ICI3D support. This will help us acquire funding for future
ICI3D programs. For attendees of MMED 2017, please use the following
statements:

**(1) A group project leads to publication:**

"This publication arose out of the 2017 Clinic on Meaningful Modeling of
Epidemiological Data (MMED), a program of the International Clinics
for Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data (ICI3D). MMED 2017 was
supported by the World Health Organization, the National Institute of
Health (NIH) National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) MIDAS grant
U54GM111274, South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in
Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis, and the African Institute for
Mathematical Sciences. Development of the ICI3D program was supported
by NIH NIGMS grant R25GM102149."

**(2) Other publications for which you feel MMED sufficiently
contributed towards for acknowledgement**

"Development of this research was aided by attendance to the 2017
Clinic on Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), a
program of the International Clinics for Infectious Disease Dynamics
and Data (ICI3D). MMED 2017 was supported by the World Health
Organization, the National Institute of Health (NIH) National
Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) MIDAS grant U54GM111274,
South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological
Modelling and Analysis, and the African Institute for Mathematical
