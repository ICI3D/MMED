## Overview

This group will address the research question "What is the long-term expectation for the seasonal difference in COVID (hospitalization) burden, and how does this compare to influenza?"

## Things to consider

- When deciding on your interest in this project, please consider the following:
    - The starting point for this project will be to reproduce the results from a published paper.

- _This group is recommended for:_
    - Participants who are interested in practicing developing model worlds to address a specific research question and implementing models.

- _This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:_
    - Model world development and model implementation (potentially for several models of increasing complexity)
    - Review of the literature to identify appropriate model parameters from empirical studies
    - Simulation-based sensitivity analysis

## Data

- This project will involve model parameterization based on published studies.
