## Overview

Rabies kills an estimated 24,000 people in Africa every year, many of them children 15 years and below. Almost always, the disease is transmitted to humans through bites from infected domestic dogs. Effective vaccines against dog rabies and human rabies exist and a global target for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies has been set for 2030.

Kenya has developed and adopted an elimination plan focused on mass dog vaccinations, timely access to post-bite vaccines, enhanced surveillance, rapid response to outbreaks and public education and awareness on rabies. Frequently, program officers implementing rabies elimination programs want to know if including dog culling and sterilization interventions is necessary and how it will affect time to elimination.

## Things to consider

- _This group is recommended for people interested in:_
    - disease control and elimination
    - learning to convert models from an ODE framework to a stocahstic simulation
    - the interaction between demography and disease dynamics

- _Using data from Kenya’s elimination program, this group will:_
    - Estimate dog population parameters that underlie rabies transmission from data from a one-year dog cohort study
    - Up-date the deterministic rabies model (from MMED 2017) that tested the impact of varying dog vaccination coverage on time to rabies elimination to a more realistic stochastic rabies transmission model
    - Test the impact of dog sterilization alone, sterilization with vaccination, and vaccination without sterilization interventions on time to elimination

- _This group will have the opportunity to:_
    - Clean, manipulate and analyse field data to extract parameters to be used in their model
    - Review a previously developed deterministic model and create a stochastic rabies transmission model
    - Address an important question related to selection and allocation of resources for elimination of human rabies (see references below)
