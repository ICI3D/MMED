title: Evaluate Synthetic Populations
---

## Overview

In agent-based modeling, researchers typically create of synthetic populations
based on empirical data sources. These populations are then used alongside other
transmission modeling decisions to simulate the spread of disease.

However, agent-based models are notoriously difficult to fit to traditional data
- e.g. incidence time series - due to the relatively large number of parameters
typically present in such models. But agent-based models can also be made to
yield a much broader range of outputs than traditional models, meaning they can
be compared to other empirical measures that might otherwise be ignored.

This group will evaluate a particular synthetic population model and use
network analysis approaches to calculate non-traditional outcomes, such "travel
time" for a pathogen between one part of the population and another, and how
that varies with behavior changes.

## Things to consider

- This project will use a relative simple transmission model, and instead focus
on the contributions of other elements of the overall model.

## Background

This project will focus on the synthetic population associated with the analyses
in [this scenario analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.09.23285319v1)
using the model generally described in [this overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11003).

That model is descended from prior work on [vector-borne 
disease](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903496117),
where this kind of assessment identified several opportunities for improving the
overall model by improving the synthetic population.
