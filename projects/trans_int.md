## Overview

When we make compartment models, we make implicit assumptions about time distributions (e.g., disease latent time, generation intervals).

This group will explore the results of different such assumptions, and work on a method to fit dynamically generated time distributions to data.

## Things to consider

- When deciding on your interest in this project, please consider the following:

- _This group is recommended for:_
	- Participants interested in programming simulations
	- Participants interested in bridging between dynamics and data
	- Participants interested in fitting simulations to time-distribution data

- _This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:_
	- Practice simulating data and exploring theoricial properties
	- Practice fitting simple phenomenological models to time series data for the purpose of estimating epi-parameters of interest (e.g. r,R0) with time intervals
	- Learn techniques to deal with data availability

## Background

Time intervals have emerged as a key to understanding the links between disease-spread parameters and rates of spread. This project will focus on linking mechanistic dynamical assumptions to different patterns of disease-time intervals, and comparing to data.

## Data

Participants will select publicly available estimates of generation intervals and incubation periods.
