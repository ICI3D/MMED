## Overview

Large infectious disease outbreaks can have distinct spatial patterns at different points of the event. Furthermore, due to a changing transmission landscape (e.g., changing intervention practices or changing awareness of the pathogen), the transmission dynamics themselves can appear to change during the outbreak. This group will use subnational specific time-series data from the 2015-2016 zika outbreak to explore both the spatial patterns and transmission dynamics of the largest zika outbreak to date, which resulted in several hundred thousand cases. There are two options for this dataset (the team must focus on one):

-	Subnational data in Columbia
    - Department specific data
    - Numerous associated covariates
-	Subnational data in Brazil
    - State specific data
    - Similar data on transmission of other arboviruses (dengue, Chikungunya)
    - Data on microcephaly


## Things to consider

-	This projcet is recommended for people interested in:
    - Spatial dynamics
    - Assessing changing transmission dynamics over time and/or space
    - Influence of covariates *or* other pathogens
    - Fitting time-series SIR models
-	Using space-time data of zika cases, this group will:
    - Estimate transmission parameters
    - Infer the influence of spatial spread on transmission
    - Test various models, potentially including:
-	models that differentiate between the expansion and decline periods of the outbreak
-	models that assess differences in transmission dynamics across countries
-	This group will have the opportunity to:
    - Manipulate space-time data, match locations to shapefiles
    - Review previously published models of the 2015-2016 zika outbreak
