## Overview

We are interested in deciding whether or not HSV-2 increases the incidence of HIV-1. This is vital because if this is the case then treatment of HSV-2 could be an important part of an HIV-1 prevention strategy. However, a follow up study over a few years involving several thousand individuals will be difficult and very expensive. Before embarking on a full scale study of the incidence of HIV-1 and HSV-2 and the relationship between them, it is extremely valuable and informative to first simulate such a study. In doing so we can make assumptions about the magnitude of the effect and the sample size to help inform the study design.

## Things to consider

- _This group is recommended for:_
    - Participants interested in epidemiological study design.
    - Participants interested in simulating studies.
    - Participants interested in classical epidemiological analyses.
    - Participants with good programming skills or prior dynamic modelling experience.

- _This group will have the opportunity to engage in any of the following:_
    - Perform a statistical analysis of data.
    - Develop a simple dynamical model based on parameter estimates.
    - Simulate infection in populations of individuals with various heterogeneities.
    - Generate data from these simulated populations that is comparable to "real data" from an agent-based simulation model.
    - Analyze these data with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).

- _Sessions that are particularly important for group members to attend or review before Week 2:_
    - Thursday May 31 - Lecture and Computer Session: Study Design and Analysis in Epidemiology: Where does modelling fit? (Bruce) and Lab 3: Study Design in Epidemiology
    - Saturday June 2 - Lecture: Participatory coding for Variability, Sampling Distributions, and Simulation Lecture (Dushoff)
    - Tutorials - Randomized controlled trial lab
    - Tutorials - Participatory coding

## Background

This project will be a pedagogical study and uses data from a simulated "pilot study". The data will be analysed as though it was real data. The simulated data represent a study over 4 years in a population in South Africa. Each record consists of the personâ€™s age, sex, circumcision status (men), risk level, their number of current partners, and HIV-1 and HSV-2 status. The number of people followed were 10,000. Participants would develop a model that would be informed by their analyses of the data and would use the developed transmission model to investigate potential study designs in order to assess the effect of HSV-2 on the risk of HIV-1 acquisition.

## Data

- This project will use simulated data.
