-   Each group should submit a written report on the group's progress **by August 1**. Reports should be 6â€“10 pages (not more).
-   Reports should include the following elements:
    -   **Brief introduction** - State your research question/s, describe the data available, and outline your approach.
    -   **Methods** - Give a detailed account of your methods, including statistical and dynamical modeling. Also describe what you know about how the data were collected, including who collected the data and for what purpose. Include a link to your code repository in this section.
    -   **Results** - Describe your results to date. Include tables and figures, as appropriate.
    -   **Issues** - Describe any obstacles you've encountered, your attempts to overcome them, and what your next steps would be to address these problems.
    -   **Plans** - Do you intend to continue further with the project, and to pursue publication? If so, what are your anticipated next steps? Outline a proposed timeline for completion and submission. The faculty will provide feedback on your plans, including our assessment of the feasibility of publication and achievability of the proposed timeline.
    -   **Contributions** - Describe the contributions of each group member to the progress you've made to date (eg, who did what parts of the analysis, who wrote which sections, etc).
- Reports should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:reports@ici3d.org?Subject=Email%20from%20ici3d.org" target="_top" title="MMED Project Report submission">reports@ici3d.org</a>. Submit your report as **a single PDF document**.
- All code used in the generation of the report should be available via your group's GitHub repository, and a link to the repository should be included in the submitted report.
