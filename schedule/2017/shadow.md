The MMED 2017 program includes a number of parallel sessions for participants with different backgrounds. 
**Track A** is designed for those with a mathematical background, particularly those who have extensive training 
and/or experience with differential equation models of infectious disease dynamics. **Track B** is designed for 
those with a background in epidemiology and/or statistics, particularly those who are involved in data 
collection for infectious disease systems.
