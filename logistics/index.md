## Arrival

### For everyone
- Please review this [important information for visitors to AIMS and South Africa](./ImportantInfoAIMS.pdf) prior to arrival.
- Most participants will be staying in the Empire Building, across the street from AIMS. Upon arrival at AIMS, one or more volunteers will be available in the lobby to answer any questions you may have and take you to your room.
- **Please double check your [arrival details](./arrivalDetails) ASAP and let us know by email to <arrival@ici3d.org> if there are any changes.**
- Please complete the [Emergency Contact](./emergencyContact) and [Photo Release](./photoRelease) forms and send completed copies to <forms@ici3d.org> by 15:00 SAST on Friday 25 May.

#### For those arriving by air
- Due to the number of arrivals, we have arranged an airport shuttle schedule, and participants arriving at times close to each other will have been put into groups for collection. **If you are arriving on a domestic flight (eg, from Johannesburg), please make your way to the waiting area outside of ABSA Bank, Central Terminal. If you are arriving on an international flight, please wait within the International arrivals terminal. In both cases, you will be met by an AIMS representative, who will be carrying an AIMS sign. Shuttle times and groupings will be posted here closer to the time of the Clinic.**
- Please note that the shuttle will only operate at the specified times. You may choose to take a private shuttle/taxi from the airport, but you will not be reimbursed for this expense.
- If you have any trouble meeting up with the group (eg, due to a delayed flight), please call AIMS -- from within South Africa, dial 021 787 9262 (calling from abroad, you will need to dial the international dialing code + 27 21 787 9262). This number is for the AIMS office, which is open on Sunday afternoon (12:00-18:00) and during business hours on Monday through Friday (8:30-16:30). If you can’t get through on this number, you can try one of the mobile numbers provided in Weekly Message \#5 to report flight delays or arrival problems. You can also email <arrival@ici3d.org> at any time to communicate about your arrival details.

#### For those arriving by ground
- **All participants without a scheduled airport transfer should plan to arrive between 12:00 and 16:00 on Sunday (27 May), if possible**.
- When you arrive, please proceed to the AIMS lobby. If you have a car, you will be able to park it in the lot at the Empire Building, but be sure to let the volunteers who greet you know that you need parking.

## Welcome and Registration

- If you arrive before 16:00 on Sunday, you are welcome to come by the AIMS lobby between 12:00 and 16:00 to meet some of the MMED faculty and mentors and AIMS students and staff. One or more volunteers will be available in the lobby to answer any questions you may have during this time.
- You must register in order to receive your welcome packet and name tag. **There are two opportunities for registration**:
    - If you arrive in Muizenberg on Sunday afternoon, please come to the AIMS lobby for registration _between 17:00 and 18:00 on Sunday (28 May)_.
    - If you arrive after 18:00 on Sunday, please register on Monday morning. The registration table will be open from _8:00 - 8:25 on Monday_.
- The first session of the Clinic will start promptly at 8:30 on Monday in the main lecture hall (see [schedule](../schedule)).

## Ground rules

- All MMED participants are expected to engage fully in the MMED program. This includes attending all MMED sessions (other than those designated as optional).
- Please be aware that participants come from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures. This diversity adds greatly to the MMED experience, and all participants should strive to create a welcoming, respectful learning environment.
- All MMED participants should follow the [AIMS house rules](./AIMS_house_rules.pdf). Because all MMED students are guests of AIMS, these rules apply whether you are housed in AIMS accommodations or elsewhere (e.g., in the Empire Building).
- Laptop use will not be allowed in the lecture hall during lectures or discussions.

## Muizenberg

- The MMED Clinic is hosted by the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ([AIMS](http://www.aims.ac.za/)), which is located in the lovely beach town of Muizenberg, near Cape Town. The street address is

        6 Melrose Road
        Muizenberg 7945
        South Africa

## Facilities

- **Meals** are provided in the AIMS dining hall.

    `       `*`Breakfast`*` is served from 7:45 - 8:30.`  
    `       `*`Lunch`*` is served from 12:30 - 13:00.`  
    `       `*`Dinner`*` is served from 18:00 - 18:30.`

- **Laundry** facilities are available in some apartments. There are washing machines and dryers. You will need to provide your own detergent. You can purchase detergent from Checkers (see [map][map]) or bring your own from home. Alternatively, the Seabreeze Laundry Service (021 788 4732) is located near the Pharmacy, on the way to the beach from AIMS.
- **Wireless internet access** is available throughout the main AIMS facility. To connect to the network with your personal computer, you will need to register your computer on the AIMS network. Instructions are available [here](./AIMS_IT.pdf). Wifi is also available in the Empire Building if you are willing to pay for it.

## Things to bring or buy

- If you are coming from abroad and bringing any electronics with you, you will need appropriate **electrical converters and plug adapters**. Phones and computers (and some digital cameras) usually come with a converter. Plug adapters can be purchased at the Pharmacy (see [map][map]). If you would like to purchase adapters before you arrive, you can use any of the plug types described on [this page](http://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/south-africa/) at AIMS. We recommend purchasing grounded adapters if you have the option.
- **SIM cards** for mobile phones (GSM only) can be purchased at the airport or at Checkers (see [map][map]). South Africa has strict regulations for registration of SIM cards so you'll need to bring proof of identity (passport) and proof of address (your apartment or AIMS keys and any printed letter of invitation to the workshop should suffice).
- Note that there is no indoor heating at AIMS and no central heating in the Empire Building. We recommend bringing **warm sleepwear** as it can get quite chilly at night.

## Tips for those staying in the Empire Building

- If your kitchen sink isn't draining, open the drain by pressing down on the drain plug and releasing.
- If you are bringing a vehicle, you may park in the garage at the Empire building. You should first check in with security and then move your vehicle to the parking garage.
