bio: Florian Marx is a physician and epidemiologist from Berlin who completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Ted Cohen’s group at the Yale School of Public Health in 2017 and is now based at the Desmond Tutu TB Centre (Department of Paediatrics and Child Health) at Stellenbosch University. Over the past years, Florian has conducted field work in Cape Town to better understand the burden, drivers and temporal dynamics of tuberculosis among previously treated people in high-incidence settings. Together with Ted Cohen’s team, he has developed a transmission-dynamic mathematical model to project the impact of interventions targeted to this particular group. His other research interests include drug-resistant and paediatric TB. Besides his research work, Florian has served WHO as a technical consultant on several occasions where he focused mainly on TB surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.
