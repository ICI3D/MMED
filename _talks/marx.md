topic: Reducing the burden of tuberculosis in South Africa - how mathematical models can help
abstract: This lecture introduces a 'real-world' example of how mathematical models can inform public-health decision making. Tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne infectious disease that accounts for a large burden of disease and death in South Africa and elsewhere. The lecture provides an overview of the key characteristics of TB in South Africa as well as the current challenges and open questions that need to be addressed for its control. It then illustrates how mathematical models of TB can meaningfully inform efforts to reduce TB in the South African population by addressing these questions and challenges.
bio: Dr. Florian Marx is a physician and epidemiologist who is currently based at the Desmond Tutu TB Centre at Stellenbosch University. His main research focus is on epidemiology and control of tuberculosis in high-incidence populations. He recently completed his Ph.D. during which he developed a transmission-dynamic mathematical model to project the population-level impact of TB control interventions targeted to previously treated people. Besides his research work, Florian has served WHO as a technical consultant on several occasions where he focused mainly on TB surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.
