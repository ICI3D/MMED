topic: Comparing different technologies for active TB diagnosis- a transmission-dynamic-health-economic modelling study
abstract: Despite the progress in tuberculosis (TB) control in low TB burden countries, there are still diagnostic delays in existing clinical pathways. Ongoing transmission and inadequate treatment could drive resistance making TB an even bigger public health problem.  New technologies such as GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS) provide more rapid diagnosis but their cost-effectiveness is still to be explored in these settings. In this talk I will discuss how an integrated transmission-dynamic health-economic model is used to identify the optimal strategy in specific settings, taking careful consideration of patients’ needs regarding testing and treatment as well as government budget constraints.
bio: Dr Tendai Mugwagwa is a senior infectious disease modeller and health economist at Public Health England (PHE). She is also a visiting Research fellow at Imperial College, London. Tendai graduated from AIMS in 2004 and went on to pursue her passion for health sciences. She obtained a Master’s in Applied Mathematics from the University of Cape Town in 2005. She went on to obtain a PhD in Theoretical Immunology from Utrecht University in the Netherlands in 2010. Tendai spent her postdoctoral fellowship years at the University of Rochester medical centre, USA and Imperial College London, UK were her research covered within host and population level mathematical models of HIV, Influenza A, TB and HCV. She joined PHE in 2013 where she now integrates infectious disease models with health economic models to provide policy makers with evidence for public health decisions. Her current focus is on TB epidemiology with particular focus on social groups with limited access to health care.
