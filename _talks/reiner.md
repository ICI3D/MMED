topic: Quantifying the drivers of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics
abstract: Patterns of mosquito-borne transmission are frequently more local and focal than those of directly transmitted infections. While a considerable portion of this may be linked directly to the complex population dynamics of the mosquito vectors (and the drivers of those processes), within-host immune responses are also responsible for variation in both infection and disease rates. Using dengue and malaria as motivating examples, I will outline a number of techniques used to quantify temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal variation in mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics as well as to parse the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of this variation.
bio: Bobby is an Assistant Professor of Health Metrics Sciences in the School of Medicine at the University of Washington. He is a Disease Ecologist and combines his extensive background in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Probability with postdoctoral training in mathematical ecology, epidemiology and entomology, to model infectious diseases. He feels strongly that a reasonably thorough understanding of the biology of the system in question is needed to optimally function as a modeler (too frequently, models of biological systems are mathematically interesting but biologically impossible). On the other hand, real-world data are often incompatible with straightforward analysis and instead require non-standard, bespoke approaches for which a background in mathematics, probability, and statistics is invaluable.<br><br>Bobby has a diverse array of interests, most concerning the role and drivers of spatio-temporal variation in infectious disease transmission dynamics. Currently his focus is on drivers of temporal variation (both seasonal and inter-annual variation) in incidence. Additionally, from a more methodological standpoint, I am interested in developing novel modeling frameworks to assess questions of interest that are designed to incorporate and leverage 'individual-level' data related to infectious diseases.
