topic: Modelling traditional investment of HPV vaccines and full value of vaccine assessment of potential Strep A vaccines
abstract: Vaccine value can be assessed from multiple perspectives including health benefits, safety, economic impact, equity, acceptance, feasibility, antimicrobial resistance, and broader socio-economic benefits. As a case study of an existing vaccine, we will discuss health, economic, and equity impact of HPV vaccination. As a case study of new vaccines in the pipeline, we will discuss the health impact of potential Strep A vaccination, which feeds into the full value of vaccine assessment.
