topic: Extinction probabilities for tsetse (<em>Glossina</em> spp) populations in a world of changing climate
abstract: <em>Background:</em> Increases in temperatures over the past decades have led to a notable reduction in the populations of tsetse flies (Glossina spp) in the Zambezi valley of Zimbabwe. If this is true for other parts of Africa, populations of tsetse may actually be going extinct in some parts of Africa. Extinction probabilities for tsetse populations as a function of temperature has not been estimated until now. <em>Methods</em> We develop a time-homogeneous branching process model for laboratory situations where tsetse colonies are kept under different levels of fixed temperatures. We derive a probability distribution p_k (T) for the number of female offspring an inseminated adult female tsetse is expected to produce in her life-time, as a function of fixed temperatures. We show that the generating function for p_k (T) is a fractional linear type and we obtain an expression for the extinction probabilities, expected number of female offspring per female tsetse, and time to extinction, for tsetse populations at different levels of fixed temperatures. <em>Results</em> Extreme temperatures are fatal for tsetse population. No tsetse population can escape extinction if subjected, for extended periods, to temperatures outside the 16 C-33 C bracket. If the number of inseminated females is large enough, the population can still thrive even under high temperatures (28 C - 32 C). Extinction probability increases more rapidly as temperatures approach and exceed the upper and lower limits.   <em>Conclusion</em> Extreme temperatures can drive tsetse populations to extinction. Further study is needed to estimate extinction probabilities for tsetse populations in field situations where temperatures vary continuously.
bio: Elisha is a SACEMA PhD student, working under the supervision of Prof John Hargrove. The thrust of his PhD project is to estimate the probabilities of extinction for tsetse fly (<em>Glossina</em> spp) populations in field situations where meteorological conditions vary continuously with time. Before joining SACEMA, Elisha did his undergraduate studies (First Class Honours) and MSc (Distinction) in Mathematics at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria. He has four years teaching experience in the Department of Mathematics of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Nigeria.  He taught undergraduate calculus, linear algebra, geometry, and other mathematical subjects, both as a graduate assistant and as an assistant lecturer.
