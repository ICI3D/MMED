topic: Survey based incidence estimation optimisation and limitations
abstract: Estimating incidence is of critical importance in epidemiology. Unfortunately, for chronic conditions such as HIV, where there is no simple relationship between incidence and prevalence, the methods are not mature. In particular, there is not much consistent evaluation of limitations and optimization of ‘population representative’ surveys. We recap previously described methods for estimating incidence from ‘population level’ surveys. We employ a simple population model based on specified incidence and mortality. To benchmark the performance of 1) the Kassanjee estimator (based on a single survey involving ascertainment of ‘recent infection’, and 2) the Mahiane estimator (based on interpolation between two cross sectional surveys without assuming data on ‘recent infection’); point estimates and confidence intervals from both estimators were computed and compared with model inputs.
bio: Laurette Mhlanga is a PhD student at SACEMA, enrolled in the Department of Global Health at Stellenbosch University. She holds an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from AIMS Tanzania, MSc in Operations Research from NUST – Zimbabwe, a double major in Statistics and Biochemistry plus BSc special honors in Statistics, both from the University of Zimbabwe. Currently, she is working under the supervision of Prof Alex Welte on a project that involves the construction of a comprehensive survey analysis benchmarking platform and developing guidance on the primary challenges of data smoothing faced by surveys intending to estimate HIV incidence.
