topic: Defining, and making use of, performance metrics of laboratory tests -Beyond sensitivity and specificity
abstract: The most naïve textbook definitions of test performance rest on the notions of sensitivity (the proportion of positive cases correctly identified) and specificity (the proportion of negative cases correctly identified) which are taken to be innate properties of tests. The ‘context’ in which a test is used can then be entirely summarised by the prevalence. The result is that a positive or negative test, of an arbitrarily chosen member of the population, then has a context (prevalence) dependent probability of being correct – usually called the positive / negative ‘predictive value’. So much is usual. When we unpack the complexity underlying the notions of sensitivity and specificity, we also discover some refined uses of laboratory tests beyond routine identification of ‘cases’.
