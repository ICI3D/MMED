topic: Estimating cumulative HIV viral load during antiretroviral therapy and the potential role HIV antibody assays
abstract: Estimating detectable HIV viral load exposure during antiretroviral therapy, including viral rebounds between sampling intervals, is key to achieving the third-90 UNAIDS target of viral suppression to stop HIV transmission. Cumulative HIV viral load (cVL2)—area under the longitudinal HIV log viral load curve above 400 copies/mL—is a new biomarker that is associated with mortality and opportunistic infections, but to our knowledge it has not yet been analyzed for CD4 count response. We present a Bayesian analysis of CD4 count response adjusting for cVL2 as a main predictor and other variables. Further, we highlight the limitations to estimating cVL2 as a measure of cumulative antigenic exposure and propose using HIV antibody tests in the place of viral load tests, which could improve cVL2 estimation.
bio: Joseph is currently a postdoctoral fellow at SACEMA, working on the repurposing of HIV diagnostic assays for HIV management and is supervised by Prof Alex Welte. Previously, he was funded by SACEMA to do a PhD in Epidemiology, focusing on the effects of longitudinal HIV viral load on treatment outcomes in people on ART in sub-Saharan Africa, under the supervision of Prof Martin Nieuwoudt. He attended MMED in 2013 after which he received an I3D scholarship under the supervision of Prof Steve Bellan. Joseph is interested in the analysis and interpretation of dynamic range of HIV diagnostic assays, for post-diagnosis patient management.
