topic: Harnessing mathematical modelling to support rabies elimination efforts in Africa
abstract: Every year, rabies kills an estimated 24,000 people in Africa. The domestic dog is the main reservoir of the rabies virus and source of infection for more 99% of human cases. Despite the existence of effective vaccines for rabies in humans and in dogs, disease epidemiology that supports feasibility of elimination, rabies continues to be endemic in most of Africa. Using data from the rabies elimination program in Kenya and projects in Africa, we examine how mathematical models can be used to determine impact of policies on delivery of interventions of dog vaccines, human vaccines, dog population control on time to elimination, and cost implications.
