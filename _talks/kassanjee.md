topic: The Meaningful Modelling of Pertussis Data for South Africa?
abstract: <em>Bordetella pertussis</em> causes the vaccine-preventable and highly infectious respiratory disease that is commonly called Whooping Cough. Trends in cases over time have varied substantially by country, leading to the renewed assessment of vaccination schedules. Questions about South Africa’s vaccine strategy have recently been posed. The ongoing modelling project that has been initiated to try to answer these questions will be summarised.
bio: Dr Reshma Kassanjee is currently a statistical consultant at the University of Cape Town, providing support to researchers from a diversity of fields – from ecology to psychology. Previously a researcher at SACEMA, focused primarily on the development of methodologies to estimate HIV incidence, her core interests remain in the areas of public health and epidemiology. Through a recent collaboration with Vaccines for Africa, Reshma is now also exploring the area of mathematical modelling for assessing interventions.
