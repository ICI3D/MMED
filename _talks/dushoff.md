session: Tuesday 5 June, 19:00, AIMS Main Lecture Hall
topic: Math and rabies control
abstract: Rabies is a horrifying disease whose effects on humans are almost entirely preventable. Within the last decade rabies has been recognized as a global public-health priority, and some areas of the world have made large strides in control, while others continue to struggle. This talk will discuss the role of mathematical modeling, and novel statistical approaches, in elucidating patterns of rabies spread, informing intervention strategies, and evaluating control progress and prospects.
