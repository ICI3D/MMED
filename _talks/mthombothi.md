topic: Modelling the effects of temperature change on the population dynamics of tsetse flies
abstract: Global temperatures have increased over recent decades. This is expected to have an impact on vector-borne diseases, raising questions such as whether increased temperature with result in changing disease prevalence and how vector populations will be affected, in terms of their density and distribution. It has been suggested that African trypanosomiasis, a zoonotic disease transmitted by tsetse flies, will exhibit increased incidence and expand its geographical range, due to increasing temperatures. This project uses mathematical modelling to assess the impact of temperature change on tsetse fly population dynamics. Understanding these impacts could help us understand how trypanosomiasis transmission dynamics will be affected by global warming. We develop set of a temperature-dependent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the growth in the numbers of pupal and adult tsetse. We fit the model to data on the number of tsetse flies (_Glossina pallidipes_ Austen) on Antelope Island, Zimbabwe, between 5 February 1980 and 29 December 1981, estimated using mark-recapture. The findings from this project concur with previous studies suggesting that temperature is the most important factor determining the growth of tsetse populations. There appears, however, to be another factor, cycling annually, approximately in phase with the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which also influences the survival of adult flies. Our findings show that minor changes in temperature have a big impact on tsetse population growth rates. In conclusion, our model suggests that high temperatures could lead to, at least, local extinctions of tsetse populations.
bio: Zinhle Mthombothi is a Junior Researcher at SACEMA. She received an MSc (Mathematical Sciences) from Stellensbosch University in 2018. Her thesis, titled "Modelling the effects of temperature change on the population dynamics of tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis transmission", was supervised by Prof. John W. Hargrove and Dr. Rachid Ouifki.  In 2015 she obtained a Structured Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematical Sciences at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences South Africa (AIMS-SA). She also holds a BSc degree in Mathematics and Chemistry, and a BSc Honours degree in Mathematics which were both obtained at Rhodes University in the years 2013 and 2014 respectively.
