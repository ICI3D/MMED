topic: Predicting red blood cell product usage in South Africa under varying health system scenarios
abstract: <em>Background:</em> The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) provides blood products and services to the public and private healthcare sectors in 8 out of the 9 provinces in South Africa.  Red blood cell (RBC) product utilization trends between the healthcare sectors are highly disparate.  The planned roll-out of universal health coverage would require implementation of systems within the blood transfusion services to ensure blood security.  Projecting RBC usage would enable blood transfusion services to sufficiently prepare for the change in health system structuring. <em>Methods</em> Retrospective RBC usage data from SANBS and South African population estimates between 2014 and 2017 are used to determine transfusion incidence per year, healthcare sector, age, and sex. The historical data is used within a generalized additive model (GAM) to predict future transfusion incidence and by consequence RBC units to be issued.  RBC usage under hypothesised scenarios for health sector transfusion incidence are further investigated. <em>Results</em> The number of RBC units issued and predicted for 2018 are comparable. A total number of 760 772 RBC units were issued between the public and private healthcare sector in 2018 (466 191 in public versus 294 581 in private sector).  The predicted number of issued units are 770 046 (452 973 in public versus 317 073 in private sector). Adjusting the predicted public sector transfusion incidence to the private sector increases the total number of RBC units predicted to be issued for 2018 to 1 451 179 units.  Conversely, adjusting the private sector transfusion incidence to the public sector decreases the prediction to 563 820 RBC units issued.  Intermediate scenarios generate predictions within these extremes. <em>Discussion</em> Predicting RBC usage for South Africa enables the blood transfusion services to be prepared for health system re-structuring.  The proposed predictive model for RBC usage performs well.  The model can capture the historical usage trends and generate acceptable predictions.  This investigation is still ongoing and further model validation will be conducted for 2019 and 2020 usage and population data.  Additional intermediate scenarios will also be investigated, for example, considering increased implementation of patient blood management, especially within the private healthcare sector.
bio: Larisse holds a BSc in Chemistry and a PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein, South Africa.  Her postgraduate research focused on the application of mathematical modelling in oncology using different approaches â€“ model adaptation and model construction.  She is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) in Stellenbosch.  Her current research focuses on blood systems analysis. Herein she is assessing blood product usage and demand in South Africa to propose a predictive model for red blood cell product usage. The model will investigate various scenarios of health system structuring.
