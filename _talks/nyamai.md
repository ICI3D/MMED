topic: Use of Bayesian models to understand COVID-19 spread in Nairobi and development of a vaccine strategy for the virus
abstract: <em>Background:</em> Similar to previous pandemics, vaccines have been proposed as one of the long-term solutions to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. The benefits and urgency of developing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine has resulted in huge vaccine demand against a limited supply of vaccines, making it difficult to adequately assess the optimum vaccine strategy that will reduce the number of severe cases and mortality. The main aim of this project was to assess the impact of the current COVID-19 vaccine strategies for Kenya on incidence of the disease, hospitalizations and COVID-19 related mortality through the use of mathematical models.  <em>Methodology:</em> Data on the number of daily samples tested for COVID-19 and the results in Nairobi were collected from the Ministry of health. In addition, age stratified population data for Nairobi was retrieved from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The contact matrix for Kenya, the seropositivity and other initial parameters were retrieved from literature . I adapted the Flu Evidence Synthesis package in R which uses Bayesian models to calculate the credible intervals from the parameters and measure the ability of the vaccine to prevent transmission using the contact matrix, the calculated age-specified susceptibility to infection, age-specified variation in efficacy, the initial fraction of seropositive individuals and the speed of rolling out the vaccine relative to transmission. <em>Results:</em> The highest number of infections were observed in the individuals between 20-49 years whereas the lowest infections were in children below 15 years. By December 2020, Nairobi County had experienced two waves with 55% of the population of Nairobi County having been infected by COVID-19. The transmissibility of the two waves was 0.3 and 0.5 respectively. The optimum scenario would be vaccination coverage of 90% of the age groups above 50 years and 20% of the age groups above 18 years. The vaccine period would take eight months.
bio: Mutono is a PhD candidate working under the supervision of Prof. Thumbi Mwangi. She has a PhD fellowship at the University of Nairobi and at the Washington State University Global Health Program in Kenya. Her PhD research focuses on urban water supply and demand and how these relate to health outcomes (water-borne diseases) in the City of Nairobi. She has a keen interest in data analytics and epidemiological modelling as applied to infectious diseases and is currently undertaking a part-time MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow. Her MSc project focuses on the use of Bayesian models to understand the spread of COVID-19 in Nairobi. She is interested in growing her skills in the use of mathematical modelling in developing prevention and control strategies for infectious diseases in Africa.
