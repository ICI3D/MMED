### 1. Poster preparation

Prepare a poster presentation to share your research.

- Poster preparation guidelines are available [here](../posters).  
- Be sure to submit your poster by the May 17 deadline, if you would like us to print it for you.
- See [this page](../posters/sessions) for poster session assignments.

### <a id="#Software"></a> 2. Software installation

If you plan to bring a laptop to use during the Clinic, please install the following programs prior to arrival:

- Excel (or a compatible spreadsheet program)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - version control software
    - Note that recent versions of MacOS come with Git installed, so you may not need to install this program.
- [Git Bash](http://msysgit.github.io/) (Recommended for Windows users only) -  command line access to Git on Windows
- R - a statistical programming language (download links for [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Linux](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/), and [MacOS](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/))
- R Studio - a user interface for R that will be needed for computer exercises ([download link](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))

Please let us know if you have trouble installing any of the above software!

> **Note:** _If you will be bringing a laptop to the Clinic_, please be sure to install all the required software on your machine before your arrival. Please also note that you will need to have administrative permissions on the laptop you bring to the Clinic. _Even if you are not bringing a laptop to the Clinic_, you will need access to a computer with both R and R Studio installed to prepare for the Clinic.

### 3. Introductory tutorials

#### **Introduction to R and R Studio**

When you have successfully installed both R and R Studio, please work through these tutorials:

- Tutorial 0: [Introduction to R Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/introRstudio.R) - provides an introduction to the user interface
- Tutorial 1: [Introduction to R and its quirks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/ICI3D_RTutorial_1.R) (required)
- Tutorial 2: [More on Vectors, Data Frames, and Functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/ICI3D_RTutorial_2.R) (required)
- Tutorial 3: [Probability Distributions and Control Structures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/ICI3D_RTutorial_3.R) (required)

- As you complete these tutorials, please complete [the associated quiz](https://survey.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cAV8F8D4hUfiXdj).

If you are unfamiliar with or rusty on your understanding of the [Binomial Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution), you may also want to work through the [introductory Binomial Distribution tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/binomialDistribution.R).

> **Tip:** To download all of the tutorials at once into a single directory on your computer, you can [clone the ICI3D R tutorials repository](https://github.com/ICI3D/RTutorials.git). You can get started quickly by opening the RTutorials.Rproj file within that directory.

#### **Introduction to Git**

In addition, please complete all 4 lessons in [this free, browser-based tutorial from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). You will learn the foundations of how to work with git to improve your workflow and collaborate on projects that involve code.

- _Basic Git Workflow_ teaches you how to create a repository for a project and keep track of changes you make to files.
- _How to Backtrack in Git_ shows you how to correct mistakes in coding projects or revert to an older version of your code if you decide to change directions.
- _Git Branching_ introduces a workflow that allows you to have multiple working versions of your code, how to bring them back together, and what to do if your versions have conflicting changes.
- _Git Teamwork_ teaches you how to collaborate on a project using git.

If you are already comfortable using git, you can skip this activity, but if you're new to git or your skills are rusty, please take the time to work through all four lessons.
