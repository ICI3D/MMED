A _few_ notes from 2018 and 19 are in the history of this page.

2021 Jun 02 (Wed)
================

## Application update

~29 applications, including Ola who didn't have to
* Africa-heavy but not ridiculous
* including a smattering from non-Africa non-NA places, some of whom will have time zone

Review process underway (John and Carl here anyway, good fellows!)
* Meet on Thu, try to finalize on Fri

## People

Bobby is on board; Mike will attend as a slightly junior faculty observer (SJFO)

Tom is expected to say yes
* Carl will encourage him to communicate with Jonathan Dushoff

Jonathan will chase Tendai a bit more (hope nothing will "detain" that mission)

## Lecture technology

Everyone is working on preparing their video lectures and will seek help as appropriate
* DAIDD survivors presumably have valuable

## Weekly messages

Start next Monday (7 Jun)
* JD and Cari (maybe Mike)

## Schedule

Migrate to a web-based, time-zone-enabled schedule

Organize links to old lecture material so people can build on existing stuff
* Maybe make links (including private Dropbox links) on a shadow schedule or something

## Projects

How big should project groups be ⇒ how many do we need, how much can we co-operate?
* 3 might be the best for managing; Jonathan is worried about slackers
* If we have some bigger groups, we can provide more than one team member

## Assignment

Everyone suggest a meeting topic for next week (edit here if you love puppies!)
* e.g., a project idea, scoping a lecture

## Consensus

Miriam should have a happy birthday!

2021 May 26 (Wed)
=================

## Application update

25 applications, more expected before deadline (8 hours from now)

Applications to reviewers by end of the day tomorrow (Juliet and Faikah)

Jim will lead review discussions

## Payment and deadlines

Deadline is not expected to be an issue

## Reaching out to more faculty and observers
* JD TODO with extreme prejudice

Mentors: Mutono and Larisse

## Projects

Becky should probably not lead a project (says Becky)

Should we break the project groups by time zones?
* How many participants will there be from each time zone?

## Session structure

How long should recorded lectures be? How do we structure them to be participant-friendly. Discuss more with Jim?

Recorded lectures should not be too long.

A few slides to guide the discussions that follow lectures

===========

## Application update

There are only 18 applications
