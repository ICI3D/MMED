Meeting 9
=========

We will be running the meetings using [a cool spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIvtczsHU98YqCq_4tdx0pWOc4ZvlBd7LmdCLt-YWko/edit#gid=0) (part of the [MMED google drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIvtczsHU98YqCq_4tdx0pWOc4ZvlBd7LmdCLt-YWko/edit#gid=0)).

Leads should be filling in their timetables backwards and figuring out what needs to be discussed with Carl and Reshma and what needs to be discussed at faculty meetings. For example, if a decision needs to be made, or they are stuck on something.

Karin-Therese Howell is representing AIMS

34 AIMS students will join the MedPH and the two-week clinic! This is all of them, which will simplify logistics.
* 13 AI 20 MSc and 1 MedPH students

Carl: Need to prepare for starting projects earlier, figure out more about marking. These changes will affect most of the role groups. In particular, pre-communication, review, â€¦

Karin will share an email address that reaches the entire group

Normally there will be three weekly assignments. Project should be done at the end of week 3 and will make up most of the mark. Assignment 3 marking can go up to a week or two late. Next block starts on Monday; it's possible to set a due date up to Sun. noon, but maybe not ideal.

We are going to have external tutors (the mentors) and Carl wants to know how the AIMS tutors fit in.

Can we get more faculty to attend the first week, either by extending or by shifting?

## Applicants

We were expecting to take 20. Given the large number of AIMS students, we should think about reducing this number. Budget implications may be complicated.

Paying participants are good for budget. Faikah will investigate and report.

16 applicants in Excel, only 5 are complete including application letter.
