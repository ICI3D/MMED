==========

Full-group call 

Show the landing page more.

Do we need to give them more time to use computers at specific times?
* There's a lot of standing around at break

Re-add a github intro

Make a local fb group and encourage them to talk about R tutorials

Ask them to install package(s)

2019 Apr 16 (Tue)
=================

Full-group call 

We all need to go over feedback from last year
* Probably the main first-week sessions can stay the same in broad strokes
 * but we can still tweak

Talk to observers about research talks

Talk to Jeff about rooms and other courses

Look at ici3d package

Juliet:
* Send powerpoints of Study Design to Jim and Alex
* Find and send last year's feedback

2018 May 21 (Mon)
=================

30 primary participants, possibly a lot of AIMS students
* Aim for 6-8 groups

Project-group feedback
* Better-defined projects, get started faster
* Communicate clearly about what data are available

People should think about ideas for project groups

Eva: MMF or join someone's group

Eduard: Does not want to use last-year's group

Becky:
* Analyzing small data sets, e.g., Lassa fever?
* Redo Stochastic seasonality?

John:
* Agent-based tsetses with Antelope Island
* Elisha should participate, ideally Zinhle as well. Maybe Annette.
* RQ: Can we build an abm? Can we fit a model of the effects of climate on demography? DD effects?

Carl:
* Analyze dengue-vaccine trial data: what is the actual vaccine mechanism?
	* A small project, people should be using stats to compare different hypotheses about how the vaccine might work
	* Concerns about how late it is in the pipeline, stats expertise
* Upcoming emergency-medicine technology trial
	* Synthetic whole-blood replacement
	* Can you simulate the process in a way that will help the trial?
	* Based on data about capacity, catchment/travel, event rates

Jonathan:
* Malaria is still possible
* Last year: dynamical fever
	* Revisit description
* Thumbi and rabies
	* Juliet and Jonathan should reach out
	* Juliet is also a possible leader

Juliet:
* Rabies (above)
* Host and vector competence
	* Host viremia profiles
	* Competence indices, encounters index
	* Representations and biases; time courses and delays
	* There are two existing host-competence formulations

Brian:
* John will reach out 

WORK on your project descriptions

* template.md (in email); gh-pages branch of this repo

Lectures
--------

Talk to students early about mentoring sessions

Everyone look at shadow schedule, and identify how ready you can be
* Reach out to people who may be able to help you with resources and ideas

Juliet will make a tentative computer-session schedule
* Prepare for these, and be pro-active

Jonathan will talk to Brian
