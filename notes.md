Meeting 7
=========

Projects group will present a plan or report next week
* Needs to be integrated with curriculum
* Priority for integration with Week 1

[First week](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fb5qT8DCURzShYe16CaBCJGAr3oWnY61-su50q-79_g/#gid=0)
* 34 AIMS participants, can we find another faculty member?
	* Maybe check with SACEMA people
* AIMS folks should be doing something project- and pedagogic-useful but which also leads into the next two weeks
	* Maybe we don't need all of the Week 1 projects to stick around
* A lot of overlap currently between Week 1 and Week 2
	* Not so clear how to resolve this
	* In the past, Week 1 students have been relatively few
* Perhaps try to adjust Week 1 with more biology and less modeling to reduce the gap
	* Make Week 1 materials available to two-week participants
	* Maybe ask two-week participants to review Week 1 material
	* Need to be realistic in terms of an approach we can achieve and will help
* Curriculum leads should prepare a side-by-side comparison to help think about adjustments
	* to the faculty ASAP; discuss next week

Elisha has two proposals

[Track A/B proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18wdIPWRv4qOXCYFN0cs3Ay3ug5EHpTLw5jZ1JVy8XUo/edit?usp=sharing)
* Basically the same as before
* Poster presentations are returning
* 4 teachers for each general lab; 6 for each tracked lab
* Optimistic that funded people would be accepted

[No-track proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZyXg2--JEycTn2EgFU9o6ullyOq9IP8f-qXOqJFYBKQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* Mostly eliminates Track B

Suggestion: Schedules should be more formatted, maybe as a spreadsheet
* Elisha is already working on this

* Bigger plan
	* Are we keeping the tracks?

	* Should we track the AIMS students? AI vs mechanistic people
	* JD: We can't just keep the old tracks; at least not without careful consideration
		* Last year Track B was almost abandoned by the end
* Suggestion from Carl:
	* Propose something with no tracks
	* Propose something else with an AIMS-based split
		* Carl will provide some informaton about AIMS coursework
* Question:
	* How are AI students selected?

Meeting 9
=========

We will be running the meetings using [a cool spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIvtczsHU98YqCq_4tdx0pWOc4ZvlBd7LmdCLt-YWko/edit#gid=0) (part of the [MMED google drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIvtczsHU98YqCq_4tdx0pWOc4ZvlBd7LmdCLt-YWko/edit#gid=0)).

Leads should be filling in their timetables backwards and figuring out what needs to be discussed with Carl and Reshma and what needs to be discussed at faculty meetings. For example, if a decision needs to be made, or they are stuck on something.

Karin-Therese Howell is representing AIMS

34 AIMS students will join the MedPH and the two-week clinic! This is all of them, which will simplify logistics.
* 13 AI 20 MSc and 1 MedPH students

Carl: Need to prepare for starting projects earlier, figure out more about marking. These changes will affect most of the role groups. In particular, pre-communication, review, â€¦

Karin will share an email address that reaches the entire group

Normally there will be three weekly assignments. Project should be done at the end of week 3 and will make up most of the mark. Assignment 3 marking can go up to a week or two late. Next block starts on Monday; it's possible to set a due date up to Sun. noon, but maybe not ideal.

We are going to have external tutors (the mentors) and Carl wants to know how the AIMS tutors fit in.

Can we get more faculty to attend the first week, either by extending or by shifting?

## Applicants

We were expecting to take 20. Given the large number of AIMS students, we should think about reducing this number. Budget implications may be complicated.

Paying participants are good for budget. Faikah will investigate and report.

16 applicants in Excel, only 5 are complete including application letter.
