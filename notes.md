## Application update

25 applications, more expected before deadline (8 hours from now)

Applications to reviewers by end of the day tomorrow (Juliet and Faikah)

Jim will lead review discussions

## Payment and deadlines

Deadline is not expected to be an issue

## Reaching out to more faculty and observers
* JD TODO with extreme prejudice

Mentors: Mutono and Larisse

## Projects

Becky should probably not lead a project (says Becky)

Should we break the project groups by time zones?
* How many participants will there be from each time zone?

## Session structure

How long should recorded lectures be? How do we structure them to be participant-friendly. Discuss more with Jim?

Recorded lectures should not be too long.

A few slides to guide the discussions that follow lectures
