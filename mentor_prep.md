Dear Elisha, Jeanette, Laurette and Mhlanga:

Thank you for agreeing to be mentors for MMED 2019.

Jonathan Dushoff and I will be working with you to prepare for MMED. Please let us know if you have any queries or suggestions regarding your role as mentors. Below is a list regarding your activities as mentors:

(1) Programming: We will continue to work via RStudio and the Git command line. We will have participants take DataCamp courses on Intro to R in advance of the workshop, and Intro to Git before group projects. You have been given DataCamp accounts and can see the online courses there. Please familiarize yourself with Git or R if you are not already so you can help students. As a reminder – please check the 2018 Clinic preparation that was required by the 2018 participants (http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/)

(2) Mentor presentations: We have 90 minutes allotted for your presentations on Friday Jun 1 so 17 minutes of talking + questions. You should see the mentor research presentation as an opportunity to practice speaking in front of large groups and to gain feedback on your work. You can present on a finished project, a work in progress, or an idea for a project you are thinking of initiating. If you have multiple topics you could present on and want some input on which to pick, just let me know. We'd love to give you feedback on your slides prior to the presentation. Please send me your slides by May 20 so we have ample time to look over them.

 

(3) Please re-acquaint yourself with the tutorials and labs (not the examples unless you'd like to). You have seen these before, but we'd like you to be ready and available to help participants move through these. We encourage the three of you to develop a schedule for reviewing the tutorials and to meet and discuss them amongst yourselves as you go. If you find any errors or feel any clarification is needed, please let us know. As a reminder – please check the 2018 Clinic tutorials (http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/)

(4) Summarising a tutorial session: Each mentor would be required to lead a summary discussion for one of the tutorial sessions and prepare slides for this. Please check the tutorial sessions and let me know which session you would like to summarize. As with the mentor presentations, please send me your slides by May 20 so we can give feedback. As a reminder – please check the 2018 Clinic Schedule to see the list of computer sessions (http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule/)

Clinic Schedule - ici3d.org
Clinic Schedule. The MMED program includes a number of parallel sessions for participants with different backgrounds. Track A is designed for those with a mathematical background, particularly those who have extensive training and/or experience with differential equation models of infectious disease dynamics.Track B is designed for those with a background in epidemiology and/or statistics ...

(5) Group projects: As mentors, you are not expected to be full group participants and should only engage as a full group member (e.g. with tasks to complete) if that's what you want to do. You're there as a mentor and facilitator. Group assignments will be flexible but we would prefer that you stick to one group, and help them throughout the week. Also, note that you are not expected to work with the group after the last week (again, unless you want to!)

 

(6) We'd like to give you the opportunity to develop a computer exercise on a topic of particular interest to you. This is optional and, if interested, please let me know as soon as possible so we can give feedback on potential topics and guidance as you develop it.

 

Finally, feel free to contact each other to facilitate coordination of your efforts (e.g. regarding questions on material, labs, git) should you find it helpful.

I'm looking forward to seeing you all in May!
