Dear Elisha, Jeanette, Joseph and Laurette:

Thank you for agreeing to be mentors for MMED 2019.

Jonathan Dushoff and I will be working with you to prepare for MMED. Please let us know if you have any queries or suggestions regarding your role as mentors. Below is a list regarding your activities as mentors:

(1) Programming: We will continue to work via RStudio and the Git command line. We will have participants go through an Intro to R in advance of the workshop, and an Intro to Git before group projects. We will send more information via our weekly participant messages. Please refresh your knowledge of Git and R so you will be ready to help students. You can refer to the Clinic preparation information (http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/)

(2) Mentor presentations: We have 90 minutes allotted for your presentations on Friday 31 May. Plan to talk for about 17 minutes so there will be time for questions. You should use the mentor research presentation as an opportunity to practice speaking in front of large groups and to gain feedback on your work. You can present on a finished project, a work in progress, or an idea for a project you are thinking of initiating. If you have multiple topics you could present on and want some input on which to pick, just let us know. We'd love to give you feedback on your slides prior to the presentation. Please send us your slides by May 20 so we have ample time to look over them.

(3) Please re-acquaint yourself with the tutorials and labs (don't bother with the examples unless you'd like to). You have seen these before, but we'd like you to be ready and available to help participants move through these. We encourage the four of you to develop a schedule for reviewing the tutorials and to meet and discuss them amongst yourselves as you go. If you find any errors or feel any clarification is needed, please let us know. You can find the tutorials  at http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/.

(4) Summarising a tutorial session: Each mentor will be asked to lead a summary discussion for one of the tutorial sessions and prepare slides for this. Please check the tutorial sessions and let us know which session you would like to summarize. As with the mentor presentations, please send us your slides by May 20 so we can give feedback. You can see the list of computer sessions on the faculty version of the schedule (which will be the most up-to-date during the planning stage) http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/schedule/shadow.

(5) Group projects: As mentors, you are not expected to be full group participants and should only accept group tasks if you _want_ to do that. You're there mostly to help and to facilitate. You should make yourself available to help your group during work sessions throughout the week.  You are not expected to work with the group after the last week (again, unless you want to!)

(6) We'd like to give you the opportunity to develop a computer exercise on a topic of particular interest to you. This is optional. If interested, please let us know as soon as possible so we can give feedback on potential topics and guidance as you develop it.

Finally, feel free to contact each other to facilitate coordination of your efforts (e.g. regarding questions on material, labs, git) should you find it helpful. You can do this via the mentors address on this email.

We're looking forward to seeing you all in May!

Zinhle (and Jonathan)
