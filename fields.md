## Field

Meaningful Disease modeling
* Engaging with data-driven questions
* Fundamentals of dynamics
* Making sensible models
* Formally fitting or calibrating

Outside workshops (many)
* Disease modeling
* Public health and Epidemiology workshops
* Data workshops

## Goals

Specialization vs. linking
* Workshops targeted at specific groups and goals
* Advantages of linking the groups

Data ↔ modeling

Science ↔ policy
* health economics as a bridge?

## Tools

What are our relative advantages?
* Base and experience in Africa
* Cool pedagogical base
* Link with AIMS (should we try to link more to their research centers?

MMED projects
* Advantages and disadvantages
* Pedagogical vs. research projects

What can be accomplished in the workshop framework?
* We can't provide foundational training
* Issue-specific workshops?
	* could be good for funding

Follow up:
* Networking alumni
* Research initiatives
