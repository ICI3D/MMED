## Field

Meaningful Disease modeling
* Engaging with data-driven questions
* Fundamentals of dynamics
* Making sensible models
* Formally fitting or calibrating

Outside workshops
* Disease modeling
	* Many examples (should curate)
* Public health and Epidemiology workshops
* Data workshops

## Goals

Specialization vs. linking
* Workshops targeted at specific groups and goals
* Advantages of linking the groups

Data ↔ modeling

Science ↔ policy
* health economics as a bridge?

## Tools

What are our competitive advantages?

What can be accomplished in the workshop framework?

Follow up:
* Networking alumni
* Research initiatives

## Challenges

We can't provide foundational training
