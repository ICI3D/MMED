# Modernization

We need to rethink our balance between conceptual understanding and practical application of modern tools
* Are there things in the middle that we could spend _less_ time on?
	* How much deep understanding/intuition do we need?
	* How much can we build this in a couple of weeks (probably not much)
	* MMED audience vs. DAIDD audience
	* Track A vs. Track B

Need to learn
* Basics of modeling
* Basics of model _calibration_
	* Tuning, inference, prediction, uncertainty, etc...

Big picture
* Who is our audience? Rethink?
	* Should we focus on specific groups that can repeat?
	* What are possible hybrid approaches?
* What can we accomplish in two weeks?
* What is the role for SACEMA? AIMS? Other small groups?
	* Benefits to repeat attendees are also important

Framing
* Maybe start with a Williams-like science discussion
	* be pedagogical about designing it
* Solid foundations, practical applications, ask for some trust in between?
