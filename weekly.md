## Notes
* Eliminate unnecessary date and year refs (keep the dates of the clinic in Message 1, request people do things by "next Tuesday" when possible)

## Message 6 (SEND ON MONDAY OF FIRST WEEK!)

We hope you're enjoying the Clinic so far!

Just a few final notes to help you get the most out of the next two weeks:

- All of the project descriptions are now posted on the [Projects](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/) page, including a few that were added over the weekend. We recommend taking a look at all of the potential projects before Thursday afternoon.
- All participants have been assigned to one of two tracks:
    - **Track A** is for those of you with a more mathematical background.
    - **Track B** is for those of you with a background in epidemiology or public health.
    - There are _two exceptions_ to this: If you've previously attended the DAIDD clinic, you've been placed in Track A. If you've previously attended the MMED clinic (eg, as a MedPh student), you've been placed in Track B.
    - Track assignments are available from [this link](www.ici3d.org/MMED/participants/trackAssignments), and also indicated by color (A = red, B = blue) on the participant facebook.
    - We have considered the track assignments carefully and ask that you not change tracks; however, if you feel strongly that you would get more out of being in the other track, please discuss this with **Faikah Bruce**, who will reassign you if she agrees.
- In the second week of the Clinic, there are several opportunities for participants to sign up for short one-on-one meetings with the MMED faculty. These are referred to as **Mentoring Sessions** on the schedule. These meetings are an opportunity for you to get to know the faculty better and for you to make sure you get _what you need_ from the Clinic. You can use the time however you like - e.g., to seek career advice, get guidance on a research project, or find out more about the faculty member's background. We suggest you pay close attention through the first week to figure out which faculty member/s you would most like to meet with. At the end of the week, you'll be given an opportunity to sign up for meetings. You can also learn more about each of the faculty members from the links provided on the [MMED Instructors page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/team/).

Thanks for reading, and have a great Clinic!

## Message 5 (combined 5-6 from previous year)

Some final notes on preparing for the Clinic:

1. Please make sure your poster is ready to go ([see guidelines](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/posters)). All posters that we received by the deadline have been sent for printing. If we have not received your poster, please be aware that the deadline for printing has passed and we expect you to print it and bring it with you. Everyone should also bring an electronic copy of their poster.

1. Please ensure you have completed the required R and git tutorials and the associated online [quiz](https://survey.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cAV8F8D4hUfiXdj).

1. Please note that we have posted the first set of possible projects on the [projects page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/). We will be posting more over the next few days. We recommend that you browse through the project descriptions before the Clinic to familiarize yourself with the options.

1. Now is a good time to double-check that you have all of the [necessary software](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation#Software) installed on the computer you will be using. 

1. Please fill out the attached forms (for photo release form and emergency contact) and return them to <forms@ici3d.org> form **by the end of the day on Monday!**

1. Finally, please do not hesitate to let us know at <faculty@ici3d.org> if you have any questions!

We are looking for to seeing you next week!

## Message 4

The Clinic is approaching at rate 1!

This week, we ask that you:

1. Begin to familiarize yourself with git, the version control system we'll be using for collaborative projects. To do this, please complete [this free, browser-based tutorial from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). If you are already comfortable using git, you can skip this activity, but if you're new to git or your skills are rusty, please take the time to work through all four lessons (Basic Git Workflow, How to Backtrack in Git, Git Branching, and Git Teamwork). Investing 2-3 hours of time learning git _now_ will pay off down the line! More information is available on the [preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation).

1. Please complete [the quiz associated with R tutorials 0-3](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewzWcNolLzhBhLD), if you have not already done so.

1. Submit your poster to <posters@ici3d.org> by 17:00 SAST on May 17, if you would like to have your poster printed for you and delivered to AIMS.

1. Check out the [MMED clinic website](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED), for the latest version of the draft schedule, and more.

If you are a facebook user, you are also encouraged to join [our facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/206225166162804/).

In addition, we would like to make sure you are aware that you will be working on group projects during the second week of the Clinic and that you will be responsible for submitting a written report on your project by August 1. Guidelines for preparing and submitting the report are available [here](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/projects/projectReports). We will begin providing outlines of potential projects next week. In the meantime, if you have a data set that you would be able to share and that you think could form the basis of a good project, please let us know as soon as possible, and **no later than 12:00 SAST on Monday 20 May**, by sending an email to <projects@ici3d.org>.

## Message 3

This week, please begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used at MMED. You can find a list of software to install (along with information about poster preparation and other preparatory materials) linked from the [Preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation).

We ask that you install R and Rstudio on a computer and begin to work with them this week. **You should work through the Rstudio tutorial and the three introductory R tutorials (i.e. Tutorials 0-3 on [the preparation page](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED/preparation/) before the Clinic and complete [the associated quiz](https://survey.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cAV8F8D4hUfiXdj) here.** If you are already an intermediate or advanced R user, you may skip to the Benchmark Questions for Tutorials 1-3, and complete the quiz. If you find that you are unfamiliar with any of the material covered in the questions, we recommend that you work through the associated tutorial.

Please feel free to email us at <faculty@ici3d.org> with any thoughts or questions you have as you prepare for the Clinic.

## Message 2

## Message 1

You are receiving this email because you will be participating in the 2021 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED), to be held online from June 28-July 9. Twice weekly between now and the Clinic, you will receive a message from the MMED Faculty asking you to look at certain information or complete specific tasks in preparation for the Clinic.

Please note that you will need access to the MMED participants GitHub repository to prepare for the Clinic. You will be invited to join the repository after you've completed the following steps:

- Create a GitHub account (register for an account at <https://github.com/>; you may skip this step if you already have a GitHub account)
- Email your GitHub username and a recent photograph to <github@ici3d.org> by Monday 14 June.

Photographs will be used to create a directory of participants. If you would prefer that your photo be shared only among Clinic participants, please indicate that in your email. Otherwise, the directory will be made publicly available.

See [the Clinic website](http://www.ici3d.org/MMED) for more information; we will be updating frequently between now and the Clinic.

We are looking forward to seeing you!
